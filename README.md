# tommyroar.github.io

This is the source for my personal GitHub Pages site, built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

## Local Development

To run the site locally:

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install mkdocs-material
    ```
2.  Serve the site:
    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

## Deployment

Changes pushed to the `main` branch are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
