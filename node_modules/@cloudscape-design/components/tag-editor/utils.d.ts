/**
 * Compares the initial tags with the current tags passed to the tag editor
 * and returns the differences, identifying which tags have been created or removed.
 *
 * This utility can be used to track tag changes and inform your tagging service about
 * the removed and added tags.
 *
 * @param initialTags - The original tags fetched from the backend or tagging service.
 * @param tags - The current tags provided to the tag editor, including any new or modified tags.
 * @returns An object containing two arrays:
 * - `created`: An record of tags that are new or updated (with modified values).
 *    Each tag is represented by its `key` and `value`.
 * - `removed`: An array of tag keys that were present in the initial tags but marked for removal.
 *
 * Updated tags are treated as both `created` and `removed` tags.
